People For Responsible Phone Use Lock is a proof-of-concept iPhone application written in Swift to demonstrate an augmented reality puzzle that 
acts as a deterrent to overuse of certain applications such as social media.

With the amount of time people spend using their phone or other smart devices, it can easily prevent us from completing tasks with purpose. Weâ€™ve developed an app that uses augmented reality matching puzzles to deter people from using media-consumption applications for an extended period of time.
